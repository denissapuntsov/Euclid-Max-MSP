Euclid is a granular sampler and rhythm generator, designed to cut audio samples into rhythms based on equidistant dispersion of "pulses" over a select number of "beats". 

In the lefthand upper corner is the drag-and-drop sample window for whatever sound you choose to process.

Below the sample window are four slider controls for creating a 1- to 16-step Euclidian sequence. 

- cycleMin and cycleMax form limits of a loop; note that changing these parameters while leaving the loop's length the same (ex. 2; 8 and 4; 10) will produce different results.

- stepAm and pulseAm determine the length of one sequence and the amount of pulses to distribute equidistantly along that sequence. If the loop is longer than a sequence, the sequence is repeated across the loop until the loop is filled. 

The resulting sequence is visualized on the circular  display in the lefthand upper corner.

To the right of the sliders are 6 buttons:

- ON/OFF starts and stops the sequence.

- reset starts the sequence over on the fly.

- BPM (default 120) 

- link creates a "tape recorder" effect when changing the BPM changes the granules' pitch.

- granule length (default 50)

- lim/set changes the mode of granule length parameter to either set the ceiling for a randomised length (lim) or set a fixed length (set)

Step-by-step pitch controls are set using dials on the bottom of the patch.

Additionally, global pitch change, the value of which combines with dial values, can be set using the slider to the left of the dials.
